> Presets for Adobe apps

See also my scripts, placed in seperate repos:

- [Scripts for InDesign](https://github.com/runxel/indesign-scripts)

## Where to put

### On Mac üçé
Default: `/Applications/<app>/Presets/`  
InDesign is some kind of outlier, tho. They also use `/Users/<user>/Library/Preferences/Adobe InDesign/<ver>/<lang>/`

### On Windows
- `C:\Program Files\Adobe\<app>\Presets\` ‚Äì local for this PC, but every user  
- `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\<app>\Presets` ‚Äì specific to the user, independent from the PC
- Sometimes they do not adhere to the structure above, tho. E.g. Illustrator places the scripts of the German Windows version into: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator <ver>\Presets\de_DE\Skripten`
